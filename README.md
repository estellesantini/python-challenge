## Description
The objective of this project was to iterate through basic data structures to complete two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. I learned how to store content in variables, lists, and how to debug and commit changes to Git along the way. 

## PyBank
In the PyBank challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I leveraged the financial dataset called budget_data.csv that is composed of the columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". I was tasked with calculating and exporting a text file with the following analysis results:

- The total number of months included in the dataset

- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll
In the PyPoll challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. I worked with a given set of poll data called election_data.csv that consisted of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I was tasked with creating a Python script that calculates and exporting a text file with the following analysis results:

- The total number of votes cast

- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won

- The total number of votes each candidate won

- The winner of the election based on popular vote
